# vue-pages

This project is one of the working examples from the book [Beginning Vue 3 Development](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Vue-Development-Vue-js-development/dp/B0BM3PQD36) by Greg Lim.

You can view the current version of the app [here](https://meutband.github.io/vue-pages/).

**NOTE**: vue-router was added separately to showcase the multiple examples built from the book. Routes are '/vue-pages/PAGE' to match 'vue-pages' endpoint for github pages.
